Technical Task initial project
I have attached my assignments for both tasks. There are two different files.
 
Let me summarize here what I have done. In case of if you forward this mail.
 
I have changed the Architecture of classes. There was only one class for all tests but I have created one main class for all test cases and separate classes for each test case. In this way I could manage the test cases easily. I have fixed the errors which were on previous mails. Tests should run without an error.
I have also edited the testng.xml file to support multiple threads for parallel executions. Please find my extra thoughts as a command line inside of the Code.
 
Please let me know if you need clarification or something else.
 
Best regards and have a great week
