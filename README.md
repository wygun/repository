Technical Task initial project
I have attached my assignments for both tasks. There are two different files.
 
Let me summarize here what I have done. In case of if you forward this mail.
 
For Task1: I have changed the Architecture of classes. There was only one class for all tests but I have created one main class for all test cases and separate classes for each test case. In this way I could manage the test cases easily. I have fixed the errors which were on previous mails. Tests should run without an error.
I have also edited the testng.xml file to support multiple threads for parallel executions. Please find my extra thoughts as a command line inside of the Code.
 
For Task 2: I have attached Postman Collections.json file. In Collections there are 5 commands with Test cases. I have seen that the Website provided random id when I try to create new employee, that is why I needed to check this ID after run my first two cases, then I have used the same ID to update and delete the same employee. I am sure that when someone run the test cases only first two test cases will run successfully. Remaining cases are going to failed due to above Explanation.
 
Also I have seen from the given Task that Delete command used with update in the given URL. I think it is written by mistake and I included the URL as contain /delete/ function
 
Please let me know if you need clarification or something else.
 
Best regards and have a great week
