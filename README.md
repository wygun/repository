Technical Task initial project

For the technical task that I have given.
I have changed the Architecture of classes. There was only one class for all tests but I have created one main class for all test cases and separate classes for each test case. In this way I could manage the test cases easily. I have fixed the errors which were on previous mails. Tests should run without an error.
I have also edited the testng.xml file to support multiple threads for parallel executions. Please find my extra thoughts as a command line inside of the Code.
 

To run the automated test cases Please configure your chrome driver path at SELENIUM_FOLDER; 
all tests can be run separately or together.

Please let me know if you need clarification or something else.

Best regards and have a great week
